  <h4>My Journey to Becoming a Developer</h4>
  <br>
  <p>I graduated from Bristol with a Physics degree in 2011. After a year or so of internships and exploring some new continents,
    I succumbed to the inevitable and joined a bank. I built up some valuable professional skills in the Financial Sector and over 5
    years, discovered that I found programming far more engaging and satisfying than any other part of my role. In July this year I
    quit my job to join Makers Academy and become a developer. I'm super excited to be starting a career where I get to solve problems
    and learn new things every day.
